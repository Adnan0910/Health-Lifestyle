Reflection on the Health and Lifestyle Data Analysis and Linear Regression Model
Problem Description
For this project we wanted to develop a model that could predict a person's weight (Weight_kg), based on health and lifestyle behaviors such as age (Age), height (Height_cm), and exercise rate (Exercise_Freq).
Solution Implemented
The Health & Lifestyle  dataset was imported into a pandas DataFrame, and select columns of interest were chosen for analysis. Missing values were present (most notably in the Exercise_Freq column), and those rows were subsequently dropped in the interests of the dataset quality before encoding the categorical feature Exercise_Freq electronically with the labelencoder class so that it could be used in the regression model. The data were split into training and test sets, and were comprised of 70% of the dataset for training purposes and 30% of the dataset for test evaluation. The LinearRegression model was instantiated and trained with Age variables, Height_cm and Exercise_Freq's labels as predictors of Weight_kg. The metric outputs used to evaluate the models performance were MSE and RMSE.
In addition, multiple visualizations were incorporated in an effort to describe the data and relationships within the variables. These included an age distribution histogram, a scatterplot of weight by height, which was broken down by exercise frequency, a box plot of weight distribution by exercise frequency, correlation heatmap of the numerical features in the dataset.
Reflection and Next Steps
The linear regression model has an RMSE of 14.90 kilograms and is a reasonable baseline for weight predictions. There were valuable revelations in the visualizations, such as the positive relationship between weight and height (split by exercise frequency), the variance in distribution of weight at different frequency levels, and the level of the linear relationships among the features themselves. 
While the model is a good place to start, there are some ideas of what could be done next that could improve our results. Feature engineering on the continuous features could also include new variables, like BMI, or interaction between features. For categorical features, Exercise_Freq could be One-Hot Encoded instead of Label Encoded, as there is no obvious order to the exercise frequencies, and we could also performance similar encoding with Gender and Smoker status as other categorical variables to improve the prediction degree of accuracy. 
We can also look at other regression models, like polynomial regression, decision tree regression, random forests, or other methods such as gradient boosting that may help realize a non-linear contribution to an outcome variable. Hyperparameter tuning and cross validating approaches are other methods that could help us to optimize and evaluate the model in a robust manner. Residual analysis could be checked on to help us verify model assumptions and also find further areas of improvement. Lastly, we could investigate outliers in the dataset, and attempts to appropriately handle these, would improve reliability and predictive power as well.
